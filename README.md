# Welcome to my first OpenGL project!
### This is an OpenGL built with GLFW, GLAD, and GLM


### This is the first OpenGL project I have made on my own, without the tutorial's guiding hand.
### This is to prove my knowledge of the concepts that I have learned up to this point (Learn OpenGL - Getting Started).


## Requirements:
### CMake - 4.0.0
### A C++17 Compiler


## Build Instructions:
### This project is designed to be run from the root directory.
### Build CMake with cmake -B build
### Build the program with 'cmake --build build'
### Run the executable with './build/Debug/First-OpenGL-project.exe'
#### Note that the executable's location may be different for you, mine happens to be in 
#### the './build/Debug' directory.
